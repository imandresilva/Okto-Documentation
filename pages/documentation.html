        <p>
            Video games tend to be composed of lots of GameObjects that must interact
            with each other. This can lead to a large amount of complexity when
            connecting them. Each GameObject must find and hold a reference to
            other GameObjects that it is interested in. Not only that, but if a
            GameObject's behaviour changes, it could impact all other GameObjects
            that hold a reference to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is what is commonly called
            <mark>Coupling</mark>
            . The simplest
            definition is: "if changing one part of the code requires changing
            another part of some diferent code, then those two parts are coupled."
        </p>
        <p>
            The implication is that, if your GameObjects are tightly coupled (another
            way of saying that a change could impact multiple other GameObjects),
            then suddenly every change you make is dangerous, because it could break
            other systems that you had already finished.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite all of these downsides, coupling is inevitable. Your GameObjects
            need to talk to other GameObjects, otherwise your game wouldn't be a
            game. There are, however, things we can do to reduce the impact of making
            changes in our GameObjects.

        After you've had some time to try out Okto, please consider leaving
        a review on the <a href="https://u3d.as/33eb">Asset Store</a>. It makes a world of difference and
        allows us to keep improving Okto and creating new assets for the
        community to use!

        <h3 id="installation">Installation instructions</h3>

        <h4 id="fresh-install">Fresh Install</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                If you have not purchased Okto, you can do so on the
                <a href="https://u3d.as/33eb">
                    Unity Asset Store.
                </a>
            </li>
            <li>Inside the Unity editor open the Package Manager.</li>
            <li>Search for Okto, and open it.</li>
            <li>Press download, followed by import.</li>
            <li>
                If it's your first time using Okto, you should import
                everything. If not, feel free to not import the Demo scenes
                (under the <kbd>Sylvan Studios/Okto/Demos</kbd> directory).
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are using <a
                    href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html">
                assembly definitions</a>, make sure you reference the Okto
                assembly. Instructions can be found <a
                    href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptCompilationAssemblyDefinitionFiles.html">here</a>.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Updating</h4>
        <warn>
            IMPORTANT: Make sure you have a backup of your project before
            updating any asset.
        </warn>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Delete the Okto folder. Due to how the Asset Store importer
                works, if you don't do this step you might end up with
                duplicated files or other issues.
            </li>
            <li>Follow the steps for a <a href="fresh-install">fresh install</a>.</li>

                <a href="/Okto-Documentation/pages/changelog">changes</a> for
                your updated version of Okto.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="what-is-okto">What is Okto?</h3>
        <p>
            Okto provides an event aggregator for developers. It allows you
            to send events through a topic and receive them in other scripts
            which you have indicated are interested in the same topic. Okto
            operates without requiring those who send event to know about
            whoever is interested in receiving events. This results in
            cleaner, more modular and decoupled code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Okto is based on objects called <a href="#entities">Communication
            Entities</a>. These are the only objects you need to create to
            use Okto, and fall into three different categories: Broadcast
            (<a href="publishers">Publishers</a> and <a href="subscribers">
            Subscribers</a>), Services (<a href="clients">Clients</a> and 
            <a href="providers">Providers</a>) and in future, Queues
            (<a href="producers">Producers</a> and <a href="consumers">
            Consumers</a>).
        </p>

        <h3 id="entities">Communication Entities</h3>

        All communication entities must be created with an <code>owner</code>.
        The owner can be any object. The purpose of providing an owner when
        creating a new communication entity is so that the visualizer window
        can group your communication entities.

        <!------ PUBLISHERS ------>
        <h4 id="publishers">Publishers</h4>
        <kbd>Okto.Publisher&lt;T&gt;(object owner, string topic)</kbd>
        <p>
            Publishers can broadcast events of type <code>T</code> to all
            <a href="subscribers">Subscribers</a> interested in the
            <code>topic</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To publish an event, you can use the following method:
        </p>
        <kbd>Publisher.Publish&lt;T&gt;(T @event)</kbd>
        <p>
            Events can be published at any point in a C# script, as long as
            the Publisher has been created. One common pattern is to publish
            your events inside a subscriber callback.
        </p>
<!--        <p>-->
<!--            Consider the following example:-->
<!--        </p>-->
        
<!--        Example of a quest system:-->
<!--        PlayerPickupSystem -> QuestSystem -> LevelUpSystem-->
        
<!--        <p>-->
<!--            There are three different systems connected-->
<!--        </p>-->

        <p>
            To remove a Publisher, you can use the RemovePublisher method:
        </p>
        <kbd>Otko.RemovePublisher(Publisher publisher)</kbd>

        <!------ SUBSCRIBERS ------>
        <h4 id="subscribers">Subscribers</h4>
        <kbd>Okto.Subscriber&lt;T&gt;(object owner, string topic, Action&lt;T&gt; callback)</kbd>
        <p>
            Subscribers receive events published to their registered topic,
            and execute their corresponding <code>callback</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind subscribers will receive all events published through
            the <code>topic</code>. As such, you must either be more specific
            with your topic naming, or use conditional statements inside your
            callbacks to filter messages. (Okto is planned to have built-in
            filters in v1.4.0)
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, you could have the following topic, published
            by your PlayerHealth script: "player_health_changed". Then,
            your UI could subscribe to the same topic and update your health
            bar.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if you have a system that handles if your player dies,
            you're not interested in receiving an event if the player's
            health changes from 10 to 9. So, you'd have to have an if statement
            inside your callback to make sure you only execute your player
            death code when the health changes to 0.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative would be to split your topic into two smaller topics:
            "player_health_changed" and "player_died". Inside your player
            health script, you'd need to emit an event every time the health
            changes, and another when the health reaches 0.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both approaches are valid. You should find a system that works
            best for you and be consistent throughout your project.
            Our recomendation is to make smaller, more fine-grained topics.
            Even if you end up not needing a topic, the effect of calling
            Publish when there are no subscribers is, for most cases, 
            negligeable.
        </p>
        <p>
            To remove a Subscriber, you must use the RemoveSubscriber method:
        </p>
        <kbd>Otko.RemoveSubscriber(Subscriber subscriber)</kbd>

        <!------ CLIENTS ------>
        <h4 id="clients">Clients</h4>
        <kbd>Okto.Client&lt;TR,TP&gt;(object owner, string topic)</kbd>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            To remove a Client, you must use the RemoveClient method:
        </p>
        <kbd>Otko.RemoveClient(Client client)</kbd>
        
        <!------ PROVIDERS ------>
        <h4 id="providers">Providers</h4>
        <kbd>Okto.Provider&lt;TR,TP&gt;(object owner, string topic, Func&lt;TR, TP&gt; requestCallback)</kbd>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            To remove a Provider, you must use the RemoveProvider method:
        </p>
        <kbd>Otko.RemoveProvider(Provider provider)</kbd>

        <!------ PRODUCERS ------>
        <h4 id="producers">Producers</h4>
        <kbd>Okto.Producer&lt;T&gt;(object owner, string topic, OktoQueueParameters queueParameters = default)</kbd>
        
        <p>
            Producers are part of the Queues communication pattern. You can use a producer to produce a
            message into a queue for later consumption. This can be especially useful when you want to make sure that
            work is split into different frames. For example, if you have 5 enemies that need to path-find, but
            doing so in one frame causes a lag-spike, you can produce the messages into a queue, and have a consumer
            read them, one per frame, and do the required calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            To remove a Producer, you must use the RemoveProducer method:
        </p>
        <kbd>Otko.RemoveProducer(Producer producer)</kbd>

        <!------ CONSUMERS ------>
        <h4 id="consumers">Consumers</h4>
        <kbd>Okto.Consumer&lt;T&gt;(object owner, string topic, OktoQueueParameters queueParameters = default)</kbd>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            To remove a Consumer, you must use the RemoveConsumer method:
        </p>
        <kbd>Otko.RemoveConsumer(Consumer consumer)</kbd>

        <h3 id="visualizer">Visualizer</h3>
        <p>To access the visualizer window go to the top menu:</p>
        <kbd>Tools</kbd> > <kbd>Okto</kbd> > <kbd>Visualizer</kbd>
        <p>
            The visualizer is composed of two sections: the controls and the
            graph view.
        </p>
        <h4 id="visualizer-controls">Controls</h4>
        <p>
            Currently, the controls contain only one button which allows you
            to disable the automatic layout system. The automatic layout
            system is force directed, as such, it will never achieve perfect
            results. Our suggestion is to let the graph layout itself as much
            as it can, disable the automatic layouter, and then manually make
            changes to the graph so you can interpret it more easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind there are still a lot of features and improvements
            we want to make to the visualizer, so expect changes to the system.
        </p>
        <h4 id="visualizer-graph-view">Graph View</h4>
        <p>
            The graph view shows you all your game objects that own
            communication entities as nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Publishers and clients are shown as outputs (on the right side)
            of the nodes. Subscribers and providers are shown as inputs (left
            side).
        </p>
        <p>
            Double-clicking a node in the graph view will highlight the 
            corresponding game object in the hierarchy.
        </p>

        <h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>
        <h3 id="pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h3>
        <h4 id="forgetting-removal">Forgetting to remove entities</h4>
        <p>
            One of the most common issues faced by developers when using Okto
            is forggetting to remove entities before disabling a GameObject.
            Whenever a GameObject is disabled, any communication entities
            that were created inside any script attached to that GameObject
            must be removed from Okto.
        </p>
        <p>
            If these communication entities are not removed, unexpected
            behaviour might occur. Okto will try to execute the callbacks for
            any entities which are interested in that given topic, regardless
            of their owning GameObject being enabled or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            To combat this, whenever you exit play mode, Okto validates if
            there are any left over entities. If there are, a warning will be
            logged to the console, so you can unregister those entities.
        </p>
